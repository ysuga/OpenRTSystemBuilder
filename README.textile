h2. Objective & Goal

My goal is to create easy-accessable RTSystemProfile library.
This also includes NamingService library.

This library encapsulate some complicated process. Please see RTSystemBuilder.java.
Compiling JavaDoc also help you a lot!

h2. Characteristics

* OpenRTSystemBuilder allows you to read / write RTSytemProfile.
* OpenRTSystemBuilder also enables to build/activate /deactivate/reset/destroy RT-System on-line.

h2. Target System and Dependency

OpenRTSystemBuilder depends on...

OpenRTM-aist 1.0 Java: http://www.openrtm.org/

h2. Usage and References

* Download all dependencies. I usually place OpenRTM-aist(Java) in HOME directory. In this environment, I can access OpenRTM-aist-1.0.jar by /home/$(user_name)/OpenRTM-aist/1.0/jar/OpenRTM-aist-1.0.jar
* Import existing Eclipse Project.
* Define RTM_JAVA_ROOT Class path Variables in Eclipse (Menu > Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables) I usually use $(HOME)/OpenRTM-aist/1.0/jar as RTM_JAVA_ROOT.
* Enjoy.
